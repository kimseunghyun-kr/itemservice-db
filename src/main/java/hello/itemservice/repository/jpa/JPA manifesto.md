Managing objects in a relational database while adhering to object-oriented programming (OOP) principles poses several challenges and issues. In this document, we will explore these challenges in detail and discuss potential solutions.

Paradigm Mismatch:
OOP and relational databases have different data modeling and querying approaches, leading to a paradigm mismatch. While OOP provides features like abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism for managing complex systems, relational databases rely on SQL for data manipulation, lacking inherent support for some OOP features.

Mapping Complexity:
Persisting objects in relational databases requires mapping object-oriented classes to database tables and handling relationships, which can become complex as class hierarchies and associations grow. Different approaches like Table-Per-Class Hierarchy, Table-Per-Subclass, and Table-Per-Concrete-Class add to the mapping challenges.

Inheritance:
Storing objects with inheritance relationships in a relational database can result in complicated operations, necessitating data decomposition into separate tables. Querying such objects may involve multiple JOIN operations and create complex code.

Polymorphism:
Achieving polymorphic behavior in queries, where objects of different subclasses are treated as instances of their common superclass, can be challenging and may lead to performance issues due to the limitations of JOIN operations.

Class Hierarchy Division:
Organizing classes into a meaningful hierarchy is essential for code reusability and maintainability. However, mapping class hierarchies to database tables may require multiple mapping methods as the number of classes increases, leading to code duplication and management difficulties.

Query Complexity:
As the number of objects and associations grows, constructing SQL queries for complex relationships becomes cumbersome. Object-oriented traversal of class/object relations may be limited by the number of joined tables in SQL, affecting performance.

Abstraction and Encapsulation:
Relational databases lack native support for encapsulating and abstracting data, as they expose data through table structures. OOP principles advocate hiding implementation details, which may not be fully achievable in a relational database context.

Object Reliability:
Due to limitations in relational databases, it may not be possible to pre-load all objects into memory, leading to potential object reliability issues as not all objects can be accessed directly when needed.
